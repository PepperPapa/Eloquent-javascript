<!-- Content negotiation
One of the things that HTTP can do, but that we have not discussed
in this chapter, is called content negotiation. The Accept header for a
request can be used to tell the server what type of document the client
would like to get. Many servers ignore this header, but when a server
knows of various ways to encode a resource, it can look at this header
and send the one that the client prefers.
The URL eloquentjavascript.net/author is configured to respond with
either plaintext, HTML, or JSON, depending on what the client asks for.
These formats are identified by the standardized media types text/plain,
text/html, and application/json.
Send requests to fetch all three formats of this resource. Use the
setRequestHeader method of your XMLHttpRequest object to set the header
named Accept to one of the media types given earlier. Make sure you set
the header after calling open but before calling send.
Finally, try asking for the media type application/rainbows+unicorns and
see what happens. -->
